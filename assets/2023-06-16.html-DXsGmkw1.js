Error handling for small objects will kill us, and we don&#39;t want to make allocation of any class instance be failable. That said, allocating an array that could be 16GB definitely can fail. On the third hand, core data structures like Array probably don&#39;t want to expose memory allocation failability to the client by default for usability reasons.</p><p>It would be interesting to explore making these different APIs, possibly overloaded with a keyword argument or something. As one idea, we could make <code>UnsafePointer[T].allocate()</code> non-failable, but make <code>UnsafePointer[T].allocate(Int)</code> failable. We&#39;d still have to decide what to do with that at the Array api level, but it too could have overloads for <code>arr.resize(n)</code> vs <code>arr.resize(checked = n)</code> or something like that.</p>',5),D={href:"https://github.com/modularml/mojo/discussions/377#discussioncomment-6188353",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A=e("h3",{id:"first-class-lifetimes",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#first-class-lifetimes"},[e("span",null,"First Class Lifetimes")])],-1),S=e("p",null,"I'm optimistic the Mojo lifetime solution will be a nice step forward in both usability and expressivity vs rust, and first class lifetimes are very nice for inner pointers etc.",-1),P={href:"https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/307291.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},B={href:"https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1098713601386233997/1118249300405780541",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},R=e("h3",{id:"untyped-mojo-improvements-over-python",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#untyped-mojo-improvements-over-python"},[e("span",null,"Untyped Mojo Improvements over Python")])],-1),W=e("p",null,"The easy answers are that the compiler eliminates a ton of overhead compared to the interpreter even if the individual operations are the same, and our dynamic object representation is a variant on the stack for simple things like numbers instead of a heap box, which is a huge win.

It is directly related to string_view in C++, the LLVM data structures predate the C++ STL growing all these things. The idea of a <code>pointer + extend without ownership</code> is more general than a <code>reference to a specific owning data structure</code> because it type erases the concrete storage type. For example, an LLVM StringRef can point into C array, an std::vector, or one of the zoo of other specialized storage types llvm has - it can even point to a scalar on the stack.</p><p>Per the comments above, I think actually calling this sort of type <code>ArrayRef</code> and <code>StringRef</code> in mojo would be super confusing if we have <code>ref</code> as a different concept.
