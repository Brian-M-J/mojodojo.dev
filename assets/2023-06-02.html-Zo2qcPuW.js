If you dig into this, every layer is problematic. PyTorch and Tensorflow weren&#39;t really designed for this complicated world we have today, they were designed for when models could be trained and fit onto a single GPU. Tensorflow can scale to many machines, but most researchers are using PyTorch which doesn&#39;t have those capabilities.</p><p>The main thing that Modular is fighting against is all this complexity:</p><ul><li>Hardware accelerators and software stacks to interact with the hardware</li><li>Modeling constantly changing with new research and huge amounts of diversity</li><li>Serving technology like zero copy networking, asyncio etc. that hasn&#39;t made it into machine learning</li></ul><p>These things have been built up over many years in their own silos and there hasn&#39;t been a first principles rethink, Modular has an amazing team to create a unified platform that solves this issue because we&#39;ve worked on a lot of these silos including Tensorflow, TPUs, PyTorch Core, ONNXRuntime, Apple accelerators etc.</p><p>Our joking mission statement is to &quot;Save the world from terrible AI software&quot;, so we need a syntax, and we wouldn&#39;t have to build the programming language if it already existed, if Python was already good enough we would have just used it, we&#39;re not doing very large scale expensive engineering projects for the sake of it, it&#39;s to solve a problem.</p><p>In the early days of PyTorch and Tensorflow things were basically CPU and CUDA, so for a dense layer with matrix multiplication you could kick off a CUDA kernel on GPU, or use something like Intel MKL for CPU. Now you have an explosion of hardware on one end with thousands of different types of hardware, and explosion of development in AI models on the other end with thousands of different operators.

In the absence of traits/protocols (which is scheduled to start soon) we can&#39;t reason about what members a generic AnyType has, nor can we constrain that type. This is actually a pretty big deal, because we don&#39;t have the infra to map back to what a substituted type&#39;s destructors are. As a consequence of this, it is only possible to use trivial types like Int/FP with generic algorithms. This is incredibly constraining right now üôÅ</p><p>There is a separate issue where register_passable and memory-only types have different concrete ABIs / conventions. This is solvable in a simple way (just treat register passable types as memory abi when generic) or a fancier way (delay binding of ABI until type substitution)... but until we solve the trait issue, we&#39;ll still only be able to express generic algorithms over trivial types, even if they are memory only. So solving this in the immediate term isn&#39;t much of a relief.</p><p>The best workarounds right now are pretty ugly:</p><ul><li>Limit your generic code to trivial register passable types; e.g. add an explicit delete() method that you manually manage instead of a <strong>del</strong> method that is automatically invoked.</li><li>Copy and paste things to make them non-generic.</li></ul><p>sorry, this is pretty annoying to me too.
